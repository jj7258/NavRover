# NavRover

NavRover is a ROS-based autonomous rover project aimed at advanced navigation and mapping, developed as part of Buildspace's Nights & Weekends program S5. This project integrates a 4-wheeled rocker mechanism for stable navigation and includes various ROS packages for simulation, teleoperation, and autonomous navigation. This project is based on my final year engineering project.

## Introduction

NavRover is a versatile rover designed to perform autonomous navigation and mapping. It leverages ROS Noetic to provide robust simulation and teleoperation capabilities, making it an ideal platform for robotics students and enthusiasts. This project is an extension of my final year engineering project, further developed through Buildspace's Nights & Weekends program S5.

## Features

- **4-Wheeled Rocker Mechanism**: Ensures stability on uneven terrains.
- **ROS Noetic Compatibility**: Utilizes the latest ROS features.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Implements the DWA planner/Trajectory planner for efficient path planning.
- **2D Mapping and Navigation**: Generates and navigates detailed 2D maps using sensor data.
- **Teleoperation**: Allows remote control via *teleop_twist_keyboard* node.
- **Simulation**: Complete simulation capabilities using Gazebo.
- **3D Mapping (OctoMap and Real-Time Appearance Based Mapping RTAB-Map)**: Generates and navigates detailed 3D maps using Kinect Sensor data.
- **Autonomous Navigation Based on 3D Maps**: 3D Maps are converted to detailed 2D Maps on which autonomous navigation will be performed on.

## Future Scope (Will be implemented in near future in any order)

1. Implementation of Gaussian Splatting.
2. Implementation of custom depth/stereo-camera sensor.
3. Conversion to ROS2 Jazzy.

### Installing ROS Noetic & Necessary Packages

Please refer to this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/x5MhydijWmc?si=WYQ-wIAWBsNOwxfo) on installing Ubuntu 20.04 and Virtual Box.  
Please refer to this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ZA7u2XPmnlo?si=0cQu7ZOh-GIMOnjV) on installing ROS Noetic.  
Please refer to this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Jbyb0kQXhJU?si=8C96k2CQqmoKXb9S) on installing the necessary packages and setting up this project.  

*Note: Videos on setting up OctoMap and RTAB-Map will be added soon*

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jj7258/NavRover.git
    cd NavRover
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    ```

3. Build the workspace:

    ```bash
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash
    ```

## Usage

### Simulation & Teleoperation

1. Launch the simulation environment:

    ```bash
    roslaunch navrover_gazebo nights_and_weekends_world.launch
    ```

2. Launch the teleoperation node:

    ```bash
    rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
    ```

3. Use the keyboard to control the rover.

### 2D Mapping

1. Launch the simulation environment and GMapping node together (By default it opens to gazebo.launch, the argument is world:=):

    ```bash
    roslaunch navrover_simulation 2d_mapping.launch
    ```

2. Launch the teleoperation node:

    ```bash
    rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
    ```

3. Use the keyboard to control the rover.

4. Run the following command in the next terminal to save the map in the HOME directory:

    ```bash
    rosrun map_server map_saver -f <map_name>
    ```

### 2D Navigation

1. Launch the simulation environment:

    ```bash
    roslaunch navrover_gazebo nights_and_weekends_world.launch
    ```

2. Launch the navigation stack (Launches the move_base.launch and amcl_plus_map_loader.launch file):

    ```bash
    roslaunch navrover_navigation navigation.launch
    ```

    *Note: To change the map, modify the map_loader.launch file, and ensure the .yaml file is present in the correct directory*

3. Launch the teleoperation node:

    ```bash
    rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
    ```

4. Set the initial pose using **2D Initial Pose** in Rviz.
5. Drive the rover around until it gets localized ( the AMCL arrows become concentrated).
6. Set the navigation goal using **2D Nav Goal** in Rviz.

### 3D Mapping via OctoMap

1. Launch the simulation environment an OctoMapping node:

    ```bash
    roslaunch navrover_simulation octomap.launch
    ```

2. Launch the teleoperation node:

    ```bash
    rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
    ```

3. Use the keyboard to control the rover.

4. Run the following command in the next terminal to save the map in the HOME directory:

    ```bash
    rosrun octomap_server octomap_saver -f <map_name>.ot 
    ```

    OR

    ```bash
    rosrun octomap_server octomap_saver <map_name>.bt 
    ```

    *NOTE: The first command saves the full probability octomap, whereas, the second one saves the compressed binary octomap*

### 3D Mapping via RTAB-Map

1. Launch the simulation environment:

    ```bash
    roslaunch navrover_gazebo nights_and_weekends_world.launch
    ```

2. Launch the RTAB-Map Mapping node with Rviz (To delete the database, add the following argument at the end 'delete:=--delete_db_on_start):

    ```bash
    roslaunch navrover_rtab_package rtabmap_mapping.launch
    ```

    OR

    Launch the RTAB-Map Mapping node with Rtabmap_viz(To delete the database, add the following argument at the end 'delete:=--delete_db_on_start'):

    ```bash
    roslaunch navrover_rtab_package rtabmap_.launch
    ```

3. Launch the teleoperation node:

    ```bash
    rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
    ```

4. Use the keyboard to control the rover.

### Navigation with RTAB-Map

    RTAB-Map creates the .yaml and .png corresponding to the 3D map created, these files are then used for performing normal autonomous navigation

1. Launch the simulation environment:

    ```bash
    roslaunch navrover_gazebo gazebo.launch
    ```

2. Launch the RTAB-Map based 2D Nav launch file:

    ```bash
    roslaunch navrover_rtab_package rtabmap_2d_nav.launch
    ```

3. Launch the teleoperation node:

    ```bash
    rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
    ```

4. Set the initial pose using **2D Initial Pose** in Rviz.
5. Drive the rover around until it gets localized (the AMCL arrows become concentrated).
6. Set the navigation goal using **2D Nav Goal** in Rviz.

## Architecture

NavRover consists of several packages, each with a specific role:

- **navrover_control**: Control parameters for the rover's rocker arms.
- **navrover_description**: URDF and Xacro files for the rover.
- **navrover_gazebo**: Consists of different simulation worlds, models and gazebo launch files.
- **navrover_navigation**: Navigation stack and configurations.
- **navrover_rtab_package**: RTAB-Map Launch files based on the rover's currerent configuration.
- **navrover_simulation**: Contains the single execution launch files for 2D Mapping, Octomapping. Furthermore it also had the GMapping and display launch files, with the corresponding Rviz parameter files.
- **octomap_mapping_navrover**: Includes the octomap_mapping and octomap_server, necessary for mapping and saving the environment in octomap format.
